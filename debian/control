Description: ruby make-like utility
 Rake is a simple ruby build program with capabilities similar to make.
 .
 Rake has the following features:
   * Rakefiles (rakes version of Makefiles) are completely defined in
     standard Ruby syntax. No XML files to edit. No quirky Makefile
     syntax to worry about (is that a tab or a space?)
   * Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.
   * Rake supports rule patterns to sythesize implicit tasks.
   * Rake is lightweight. It can be distributed with other
     projects as a single file. Projects that depend upon
     rake do not require that rake be installed on target
     systems.
